<h2> So You Want To Produce Wubba Lub Lub and Noises that make visualizers go BOOM! BOOM! <h2>

<p> Well this place is a great place to start. We have tried to order some programs, videos so you can make meme worthy music, dank enough to 
grace visualizers such as DSG, Trap Nation, and Diversity's anime pictures. Hopefully good enough for people like xLucyx to download.</p>
